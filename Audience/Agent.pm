package Audience::Identity;

# Purports to encapsulate the basic functionality of an identify.  For
# instance,  one  identity  differs  from  another,  in  that  it  has
# different  contacts,  different   rules  for  contacting,  different
# personality, etc.  Identities can be  used to model other people, as
# well  as   provide  additional  "people"  where   none  really  are.
# Identities  share  many properties  with  Contacts,  except that  we
# control identities directly, something we cannot do with Contacts.
