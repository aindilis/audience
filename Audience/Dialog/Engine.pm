package Audience::Dialog::Engine;

# this is a simple system for porting manager dialog to work generally
# over  UniLang.  The  technique is  to first  create a  state machine
# model of communication, and then implement Audience::Dialog::Manager
# functions within that

# this functionality is useful, say, for busroute, etc.
